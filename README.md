# Neural Network Implementation

Project in Python for Deep Learning Methods course (summer semester 2019/2020) at Warsaw University of Technology.

Solution by Jakub Kała & Krzysztof Spaliński. 

## Content

Multilayer perceptron implemented in NumPy

### `NeuralNetwrokCore` class

This class consist of a raw neural network and layer implementation. 

### `NeuralNetworkWrapper` class

This class allows the user to train the neural network and gives him 
tools to set up batches, split the training dataset for training and validation, draw a loss function, etc.

### `LearningProcessVisualisation` class

This class allows the user to visualise the learning process on a 2D dataset.
